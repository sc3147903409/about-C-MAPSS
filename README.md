# about-C-MAPSS
This file mainly recodes my code about C-MAPSS
The main task is to use different models to predict the RUL.
Note: The utils file is data pre-processed. Some .py files use utils .py, but some do not.

This is the result of BGVER model. The jupyter code has been attached. However, the reproduction results are not satisfactory, based on FD002 reproduction.

These are some of the model's hyperparameter choices. 
Since this paper was similar to my work and the results obtained were good, I reproduced it, but the results were not as good as expected.
