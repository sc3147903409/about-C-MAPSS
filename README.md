# about-C-MAPSS
This file mainly recodes my code about C-MAPSS
The main task is to use different models to predict the RUL on the C-MAPSS dataset for some readers' reproduction.
Note: The utils file is data pre-processed. Some files use utils.py, but some do not.

# Reproduction of Chinese papers:基于双向门控变分编码回归网络的涡扇发动机剩余寿命预测 《计算机集成制造系统》网络首发论文

This is the result of BGVER model. The jupyter code has been attached. However, the reproduction results are not satisfactory, based on FD002 reproduction.

These are some of the model's hyperparameter choices. 
Since this paper was similar to my work and the results obtained were good, I reproduced it, but the results were not as good as expected.
# Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using a Variational Autoencoder-Regression Framework
My first conference paper was published by IEEE PRAI 2023, This model utilizes a Bi-LSTM to capture the sequence dependency and analysis of the time-step importance for RUL prediction.
The corresponding code file is also called "Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using a Variational Autoencoder-Regression Framework".
# 基于BSVAR的航空发动机剩余使用寿命预测方法——北京航空航天大学学报
# BSVAR-based approach for aero engines remaining useful life prediction
My first published paper, the reproduction code is in the BSVAR.ipynb file, feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for your criticism.
